Tup Mode for GNU Emacs
======================

This is a major mode for Emacs made for editing ‘tupfiles’, files used
by the [Tup build system](http://gittup.org/tup/).


Features
--------

Tup mode provides syntax highlighting for all of the elements of
tupfiles, such as rule definitions, user-defined variables, macros,
flags, bin variables, and so on.  The mode also allows you to execute
Tup commands.  It binds the following key sequences:

1. `C-c C-i`: `tup init`
2. `C-c C-u`: `tup upd`
3. `C-c C-m`: `tup monitor`
4. `C-c C-s`: `tup stop`
